  longDescription: |
    Oracle RAC is ideal for high-volume applications or consolidated environments where scalability and the ability to dynamically add or re-prioritize capacity across more than a single server are required. An individual database may have instances running on one or more nodes of a cluster. Similarly, a database service may be available on one or more database instances. Additional nodes, database instances, and database services can be provisioned online.
  potentialBenefits: Meet workload scalability requirements.

    It is important to design an IP addressing scheme taking into consideration the current and future requirements of your Oracle workloads. This will help you to avoid IP address conflicts and ensure that your Oracle workloads are always available.
    Primary, standby, client and backup subnets should be placed in separated VNets without overlapping IP CIDR ranges.
  potentialBenefits: Avoid conflicts in IP addressing for the database, application and backup infrastructure.
