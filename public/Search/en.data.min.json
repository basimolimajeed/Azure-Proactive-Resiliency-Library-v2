Business Continuity Involves strategies to maintain essential functions during and after a disaster, ensuring business operations continue. Disaster Recovery Focuses on restoring systems and data after catastrophic failures, ensuring quick recovery post-disaster. Scalability Involves techniques to handle changes in load and maintain system performance under varying conditions. Monitoring and Alerting Constant surveillance of system health, performance, and security, aiding in quick issue identification and resolution. Service Upgrade and Retirement Addresses the planning and execution of system upgrades and the retirement of outdated services. Other Best Practices Encompasses miscellaneous best practices that improve system resilience, efficiency, and security. Personalized Customized recommendations tailored to specific system requirements, configurations, or preferences. Governance Involves policies, procedures, and oversight for IT resource utilization. Ensures adherence to legal, regulatory, and compatibility requirements, while guiding overall system management. (Includes Compliance and Compatibility) Writing a Meaningful Recommendation\rWhen writing a recommendation, consider the following:\nAPRL recommendations are intended to enable and accelerate the delivery of Well Architected Reliability Assessments. The purpose of APRL is not to replace existing Azure public documentation and guidance on best practices.\nEach recommendation should be actionable for the customer. The customer should be able to place the recommendation in their backlog and the engineer that picks it up should have complete clarity on the change that needs to be made and the specific resources that the change should be made to.\nEach recommendation should include a descriptive title, a short guidance section that contains additional detail on the recommendation, links to public documentation that provide additional information related to the recommendation, and a query to identify resources that are not compliant with the recommendation. The title and guidance sections alone should provide sufficient information for a CSA to evaluate a resource.\nRecommendations should not require the CSA to spend a lot of time on background reading, they should not be open to interpretation, and they should not be vague. Remember that the CSA delivering the WARA is reviewing a large number of Azure resources in a limited amount of time and is not an expert in every Azure resource.\nExamples\rGood recommendation: Use a /24 subnet for the resource Bad recommendation: Size your subnet appropriately Not all best practices make good APRL recommendations. If the best practice relates to a particular resource configuration and can be checked with an ARG query, it probably makes for a good APRL recommendation. If the best practice is more aligned to general architectural concepts that are true for many Azure resources or workload types, we very likely already have a recommendation in the APRL WAF section that addresses the topic. If not, consider adding a WAF recommendation to APRL. If neither is the case, APRL may not be the best location for this content.\n","description":"Adding New Recommendation Recommendation Structure Recommendation Categories Writing a Meaningful Recommendation Examples This section provides guidance on how to create new recommendations.

This constraint prioritizes the target node for the resource temporarily without permanently altering the cluster\u0026#39;s configuration. During planned maintenances and fail over testing, you can leverage the migrate command for temporary resource relocation during maintenance or administrative tasks to ensure minimal disruption. This constraint is not permanent and does not survive reboots or cluster resets. It\u0026#39;s designed for short-term adjustments. Once the planned task necessitating the resource migration is complete, manually remove the temporary constraint to revert to the cluster\u0026#39;s original resource management policies.
